# FounderCal

[FounderCal](https://foundercal.org) is a focused calendar for founders who need to stay on top of accelerator deadlines, capital-raising programs, and resource drops across fast-moving tracks like AI, crypto, frontier tech, and more. It cuts through scattered spreadsheets and inbox reminders so you can see what matters, when it matters, and act before an opportunity closes.

## Why FounderCal
- **One source of truth** – Centralizes application windows, demo days, office-hour sign-ups, and funding programs from major ecosystems.
- **Founder-first filters** – Slice the calendar by stage, sector (AI, crypto, climate, etc.), geography, or participation requirements.
- **Actionable reminders** – Highlights what you can apply for today, what opens next, and what requires prep work.
- **Signals, not noise** – Surfaces only vetted programs and clearly labels perks (capital offered, mentor access, platform reach).

## How It Works
1. **Curate** – Data sources pull from accelerator announcements, operator newsletters, DAOs, investor programs, and founder communities.
2. **Normalize** – Every entry is standardized with eligibility, perks, decision timelines, and contact info so comparisons stay apples-to-apples.

## Use Cases
- Plan a quarterly fundraising sprint without missing top accelerator cohorts.
- Track AI/crypto conference deadlines alongside investor matching programs.
- Share a filtered calendar with your team so product, ops, and finance know what’s coming.

## Roadmap Highlights
- Collaborative collections you can publish or embed in community portals.
- Smart prep checklists that attach to each calendar item.
- API access for teams that want to sync FounderCal data into their internal tools.
